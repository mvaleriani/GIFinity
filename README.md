## GIFinity
GIFinity is a web-based application developed using React.js and Redux. The goal with this project was to create an aesthically pleasing interface while implementing good UX practices. The app is capable of endlessly scrolling through "trending" GIFs, querying specific kinds of GIFs, and storing those the user marks as a favorite.

<!-- ## Why was this created? -->

<!-- In 2017, fake celebrity pornographic videos called Deep Fakes surfaced, creating scandals for all involved and opening the door to what is actually possible to fake. Since it's introduction, the technology behind DeepFakes has been used in politics as well as "revenge porn". As it currently stands, only the quality of the video is able to distinguish the authenticity, and that will disappear as the process is refined.

Our goal with this project was to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of distinguishing between real and faked videos in order to protect the reputation and integrity of anyone who could be affected by faked videos. -->

  Users are able to... 
  <!-- upload a video, select the face crops they want to test, and once they have 20, run them through the model. From there, the user will wait as the model processes the image and will have the image's authenticity appear. -->
